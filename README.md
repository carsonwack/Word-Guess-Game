# Word-Guess-Game

# This Project is a "Term Guess" Hangman Game--users view the definition to a word or term and attempt to type the letters corresponding to the blanks representing the word.


# The project is useful as a fun game to be played, including an especially exciting surprise for those able to guess a term correctly.


# Users can simply visit the URL to get started.

# Users can email me at cwack@uw.edu if they need help.


# I, Carson Wack, maintain and contribute to the project.
